# agent-checklist

**agent-checklist** is a CLI tool designed for code agents like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh). It uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its runtime, package manager, and build tool. Data is stored locally using Bunâ€™s built-in SQLite integration.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Install project dependencies with:

```bash
bun install
```

## ðŸ›  Usage

To run the CLI tool:

```bash
bun run index.ts <command> [options]
```

Or, once the package is linked or published:

```bash
agent-checklist <command> [options]
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The CLI tool will provide various commands to interact with a checklist of items. These items are stored in a SQLite database managed by Bun.

> _(More details on specific commands and options will be added as development progresses)_

This project was created using `bun init` and is built with [Bun](https://bun.sh), a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
